	<h1>Why Burgers? Because They're Awesome, That's Why.</h1>

 		There are many different opinions as to where the first hamburger was made (no, it is not necessarily Hamburg, Germany) and how long ago, but there is one thing we all agree on: they are pretty damn delicious. They are beloved world wide, but especially here in 'Murica. It is a perfect food. Juicy meat, a fresh bun, and any of an infinite array of phenomenal toppings. You just cannot go wrong.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is a shared love for burgers that got the team of people behind Sauce on Sauce (SOS for short) together to bring you tasty meaty treats. Our founder, Jonathan Davis, has always had a creative culinary mind, but sandwiched beef was his true calling. Years ago he put together a menu with dreams of opening a burger joint one day, and we are lucky he did!
	</p>

	<p>
		The combinations on this menu are unique and creative, particularly the insanely popular burger lollipop. Many people have offered insane sums to get the recipe, but we will not tell. Luckily, we make a whole bunch of these bad boys daily to satisfy your cravings.
	</p>

	<p>
		When Jonathan's dream began, he wanted a brick and mortar as that was the way of that time. But as years passed and trends changed, a new craze began to sweep this great, hungry nation.

		Food trucks began as a way to fill the need to get food to people, fast and anywhere. Food carts have been around for many years, but the fare has always been simple and with minimal options. If you didn't want street meat, a hot dog, or a pretzel, you were out of luck.
	</p>

	<p>
		As we began to have more sophisticated pallettes, food carts slowly started to evolve into the food trucks we have now. One can find a truck for any appetite, and any level of "foodie" can leave the wheels of these mobile restaurants completely satisfied.
	</p>

	<p>
		We at SOS knew we had a great menu and a unique conecpt of the great American hamburger, but it was only once the popularity of the gourmet food truck grew that we knew we needed to drop the idea of a brick and mortar.
	<p>

	<p>
		Just a few months later and Sauce on Sauce's popularity has skyrocketed. With lines up to an hour long daily, the word of mouth is tremendous, with no end in site.
	</p>

	<p>
		We at SOS thank our loyal customers for allowing us to become the success we are and to fulfill our dreams of bringing original, gourmet burgers to people everywhere, fast and fresh. Give us a try and see why we are "The Bigger, Better, Bigger."
